# Hackathon NASA
## Interactive Digital Book on Space Weather

This project was developed with the goal of creating an **educational and interactive experience** about **Space Weather** - how solar activity and cosmic phenomena affect human activities on Earth. Through a **digital book with illustrations and mini-games**, users can learn in a playful way about solar storms, cosmic radiation, and their impact on satellites, communications, power grids, and more.

### Project Overview

- An **interactive digital book** with illustrated pages and educational storytelling.  
- **Mini-games** integrated into the narrative to reinforce learning.  
- A **Python API** that fetches real data from NASA databases to enrich the content with up-to-date space weather information.  

### Technologies Used

- **Godot Engine** — main engine for the interactive book and mini-games.  
- **Python + FastAPI** — backend service to fetch and serve NASA data.  
- **NASA APIs** — data sources for space weather and solar events.  
- **JSON / REST** — communication between Godot and the API.  

### Educational Goals

- Promote **scientific literacy** about space weather.  
- Show how solar events can affect **critical infrastructure** on Earth.  
- Spark curiosity about **science, technology, and space exploration**.
