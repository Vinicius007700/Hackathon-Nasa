    "One day, Raimundo went fishing, just as he always did. He was excited for another day of work when Alice appeared before him. Like a good Brazilian, he offered a gigantic smile, so intense that it surpassed the heat Alice had felt near the Sun. He then asked Alice if she wanted to join him on his boat trip.\n\t\n\tUpon getting on the boat, Alice began to explain what was happening that day. The high Kp-indices were affecting the functionality of sensors, like the GPS.\n\t\n\tWhen, suddenly, Raimundo's Furuno GP-32 GPS stopped working... Alice, being a kind and generous girl, offered to help Raimundo."
